      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that a wealthy merchant, who had many dealings throughout the lands, rode out one day to settle a matter of business in one of them. When it became hot, he sat down under a tree and put his hand in his saddlebag, from which he took out a piece of bread and a date. He ate and when he had finished with the date he threw away its stone, at which a huge ‘ifrit appeared, with a drawn sword in his hand. This ‘ifrit came up to the merchant and said: ‘Get up so that I can kill you as you killed my son.’ ‘How did I kill your son?’ asked the merchant, and the ‘ifrit told him: ‘When you ate that date and threw away the stone, it struck my son in the chest as he was walking, and he died instantly.’ ‘We belong to God and to Him do we return,’ recited the merchant, adding: ‘There is no might and no power except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent. If I killed him, this was by accident, so please forgive me.’ ‘I must kill you,’ insisted the ‘ifrit, and he dragged off the merchant, threw him down on the ground and raised his sword to strike.\n",
      "\n",
      "With tears in his eyes, the merchant exclaimed: ‘I entrust my affair to God!’ and he then recited these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Time is two days, one safe and one of peril,\n",
      "\n",
      "And our lives are of two halves, one fair, one overcast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Say to those who reproach us for what Time has done:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had finished, the ‘ifrit said: ‘Stop talking, for, by God, I am most certainly going to kill you.’ ‘‘Ifrit,’ the merchant said, ‘I am a wealthy man, with a wife and children; I have debts and I hold deposits, so let me go home and give everyone their due before returning to you at the start of the new year. I shall take a solemn oath and swear by God that I shall come back to you and you can then do what you want with me. God will be the guarantor of this.’ The ‘ifrit trusted him and let him go, after which he went home, settled all his affairs, and gave everyone what was owed them. He told his wife and children what had happened, gave them his injunctions and stayed with them until the end of the year, when he got up, performed the ritual ablution and, with his shroud under his arm, said goodbye to his family and all his relations as well as his neighbours, and set off reluctantly, while they all wept and wailed. He came to the orchard on what was New Year’s Day, and as he sat there weeping over his fate, a very old man approached him, leading a gazelle on a chain. The newcomer greeted him and asked him why he was sitting there alone, when the place was a haunt of jinn. The merchant told the story of his encounter with the ‘ifrit, and the old man exclaimed: ‘By God, brother, you are a very pious man and your story is so wonderful that were it written with needles on the corners of men’s eyes, it would be a lesson for those who take heed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He took his seat by the merchant’s side and promised not to leave until he had seen what happened to him with the ‘ifrit. As the two of them sat there talking, the merchant was overcome by an access of fear together with ever-increasing distress and apprehension. It was at this point that a second old man arrived, having with him two black Salukis. After greeting the two men, he asked them why they were sitting in this haunt of jinn and they told him the story from beginning to end. No sooner had he sat down with them than a third old man, with a dappled mule, came up, greeted them and asked why they were there, at which they repeated the whole story – but there is no point in going over it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the newcomer had sat down, a huge dust-devil appeared in the middle of the desert, clearing away to show the ‘ifrit with a drawn sword in his hand and sparks shooting from his eyes. He came up to the three, dragged the merchant from between them and said: ‘Get up so that I can kill you as you killed my beloved son.’ The merchant sobbed and wept, while the three old men shed tears, wailed and lamented. Then the first of them, the man with the gazelle, left the others, kissed the ‘ifrit’s hand and said: ‘Jinni, royal crown of the jinn, if I tell you the story of my connection with this gazelle, will you grant me a third share in this merchant’s blood?’ The ‘ifrit agreed to do this if he found the story marvellous, AND SO THE OLD MAN BEGAN HIS TALE:\n",
      "\n",
      "Know, ‘ifrit, that this gazelle is my cousin, my own flesh and blood. I married her when she was still young and stayed with her for thirty years without her bearing me a child. So I took a concubine and she bore me a son, the perfection of whose eyes and eyebrows made him look like the full moon when it appears. He grew up and when he was fifteen I had occasion to travel to a certain city, taking with me a great quantity of trade goods. My wife, now this gazelle, had studied sorcery since her youth and she turned the boy into a calf and his mother into a cow, handing them over to the herdsman. When, after a long absence, I got back from my journey, I asked about the two of them and my wife told me that the woman had died and that the boy had run away, where she did not know.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a year I remained sad at heart and tearful until ‘Id al-Adha came round and I sent to tell the herdsman to bring me a fat cow. What he brought me was my slave girl whom my wife had enchanted. I tucked up my clothes, took the knife in my hand and was about to slaughter her, when she gave a cry, howled and shed tears. This astonished me and, feeling pity for her, I left her and told the herdsman to fetch me another. At that my wife called out: ‘Kill this one, as I have no finer or fatter cow.’ I went up again to do the killing and again the cow gave a cry, at which I told the herdsman to slaughter her and then skin her. He did this, only to discover that there was neither flesh nor fat in the carcass, but only skin and bone. I was sorry for what I had done at a time when regret was of no use, and I gave the cow to the herdsman, telling him to bring me a fat calf. He brought me my son, and when this ‘calf ’ caught sight of me, he broke his tether and rolled in the dust in front of me, howling and shedding tears. Again I felt pity and told the herdsman to leave the calf and fetch me a cow, and again my wife, now this gazelle, called to me, insisting that I must slaughter the calf that day. ‘This is a noble and a blessed day,’ she pointed out. ‘The sacrifice must be a good one and we have nothing fatter or finer than this calf.’ ‘Look at what happened with the cow that you told me to kill. This led to a disappointment and we got no good from it at all, leaving me full of regret at having slaughtered it. This time I am not going to do what you say or kill this calf.’ ‘By God the Omnipotent, the Compassionate, the Merciful, you must do this on this noble day, and if you don’t, then you are not my husband and I am not your wife.’ On hearing these harsh words, but not realizing what she intended to do, I went up to the calf with the knife in my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say. ‘What a good, pleasant, delightful and sweet story this is!’ exclaimed Dunyazad, at which Shahrazad told her: ‘How can this compare with what I shall tell you this coming night, if I am still alive and the king spares me?’ ‘By God,’ the king said to himself, ‘I am not going to kill her until I hear the rest of the story,’ and so they spent the rest of the time embracing one another until the sun had fully risen. The king then went to his court as the vizier came with the shroud under his arm, and he gave his judgements, appointing some officials and dismissing others, until evening, but to the vizier’s great surprise he gave no instructions about his daughter. The court was then dismissed and King Shahriyar returned to his palace.\n",

A- man like o-ur master is too you---n-g t--o -satisfy t-his whore-, w---ho ---every night --sle-----eps outside ---the palace.’ The girl- --at- -my -hea------d -sai-d: ‘Our master is dumb and ----deluded in that -he never asks- ----que-st-ions a--bout her.’ --‘Do you t-hi--nk t---hat -he- ---knows -about her- -a---n-d --that --sh-e --does this with- h--is con---s---ent?’ -excla--i-me-d --th------e -other, adding--: ‘She -prepares --him a drin-k that he ta-kes ever-y nig--ht befo-re he- ---goes t-o -sle-ep and in it she puts a sleeping drug. He kno-ws nothing ab-out wha----t happens- or wh--ere she- ---goe-s. -After she ha----s give-n -him the drin--k, she puts --on her clothes, p-e---rfumes -he-rs-elf and goes out, leaving h--im -till dawn-. -Then she-- -comes ba----ck -t----o -h-im and burns something -under his -n-ose so th---a--t -he wa-ke--s --from his sleep.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Wh-en I hear-d ---what -the gi-rls -were saying, th---e light- became darkness in my eyes, althou-gh I co----uld not-- believe that --ni-gh-t h-ad c-o-------me-. Then -my wi--fe r--e-turned --from --the- bat-hs; o-ur table was spre---ad and we ate, after which we sat for- a time talkin-----g, --as- ---us--ual. -The--n she called- f-or my --evening --drink and when she ha-d- --give--n -me--- --the c-up which she ha-d -po--ure-d out, --I tipped the contents into my pocket, while- pre-tending to be d---rinking it as usual. I- lay do-wn -immediat--ely and,--- pret--en-----ding -to- -be asleep, -I heard her saying: ‘Sleep th-rough the- --night and- -ne---ver get up. By God, I loathe you and I loathe your appearance. I am tired of living with you -and I don’t kno---w when God is going to ta-ke -your li--fe.------’ She th-en got up, put on he---r- most--- splendid clothes, p---erfu---med herself and--, taking my sw---ord, she- stra--pped it on and -we-nt out through the palace gates, wh-ile f-or my part I got up and follow----ed -her out. Sh--e --made- ---her way th--rough the -ma--rkets -until- she---- -reach--ed the- city gate. -She --spoke -some words that I co-uld not under-stand, ----at which the- bolts fell a-nd the gate opened.\n",

      "My --wife --went -out, without realizing that I was followi-ng her, and passed b--etween the mounds -unti-l she ---c-ame -to a hut with a brick do--me. -As she we-nt in through its door, I cl-imbed- ----on --to the- roof -and looked down to see -her enter and go up to a black slave. One o-f his -lips looke--d -li---ke -a pot lid-- and -the other like the sole ---o-f a s--ho--e – a- lip that could pick up sand fro-m the --top o-f a pebble. -Th--e s-lave was lying on cane stalks; h-e was -lepro--us and covered in rags and tatte-rs. As my wife kissed the ----ground before --him, he ra-ised his-- -hea-d and s-----aid: ‘Damn- you, why ha-ve -yo--u b--een so slow? My --black cousin-s w---ere here drinking, --and --each --left with a girl, but becaus-e -of you- I didn’t wan-t ---to drink.’ She said: ‘My master, my darling, delight of my eyes, don’t you know that -I am married to my co-usin, -whose -appearance- --I -ha----te an-d- whose- company I loathe? Were -it- not that I am afrai-d for yo-u, ---I would not let the sun rise before the city had -----be-e-n -le-ft -de-solate-, -echoing to the scre--eches of owls a-n-d t--h---e cawing ---of crows, ---t-h--e ha---un---t --of --foxes a---n----d wolves, and ---I woul----d- -----move its sto-nes to behin-d -Moun---t Qaf---.’ --‘You --are lying, --damn- -yo-u,’ said the -------bla-ck man--. ‘I swear by the- chivalry of the -blacks --– and do---n’t thin-k th-at our chivalry i-s like- that o--f th--e whit---es – t-h-a--t--- if you are --as- l--ate as th---i-s- once------ more, -I wi--ll never- again -ke--ep -company with- -you o--r ---join my body to --yours. -You are playing fast and --loose- with- --me-. --Am ---I -here -just to serve -your --lus-t, -you stink-ing bitch-, -vi-lest- -of the whites?’\n",

      "As I looked on and list-e-ned to what they ----were saying, -the world turned black for me and I didn’t kno--w wh-ere I was. My wife was st-anding weeping, humbling -herself before the ----slave and sayi-ng: ‘--My------ darling, fr--uit of m----y -heart, -if -you are angry --with me, wh--o -will sa--ve---- --me, ----and -if you throw me ou-t, -who will shelter me-, my dar-ling and -ligh-t of- my eyes?’ Sh-e --went ---on weeping and implo--ring him until, to her -deli-ght, she managed to conciliate h-im. She- the-n -got up and took ---off --all --her clo-thes. ‘My master,’ she -said, ‘is there -a-------nything fo---r your servan-t --to ---eat?’ ‘Lift the --pan cover-,’ -------he -said. -‘There -a-re some cooked rat bones be---ne-ath -it that you can -eat, a--nd -you can the-n go to this jar and- -drink the -remains o--f the- beer there.’\n",
